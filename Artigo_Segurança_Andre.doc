1)  Most businesses view security as a post-development
process [8]. Security isn’t considered at some point in the
pre-development phase [9]. There is no approval for the
method to be used, we still have little understanding of
the need for secure software development. There are also
few facts about the effectiveness of existing approaches to
dealing with real problems and a limited view of how they
contribute to the assessment of safety concerns [10]. Threats
put systems at greater risk for major losses that can be dif-
ficult to recover [11]. The majority of software programs
are designed and deployed without attention to protection
desires [12], [13]. Hidden attacking risks within or outside
the organization are emerging day-by-day, results in huge
financial loss, as well as confidentiality and credibility losses
by putting the availability and integrity of organizational
data at risk [14], [15]. 

2)  based on the above evidence, we can conclude that pro-
tecting software programs in the development stages isn’t
sufficient and there is a great need to locate higher approaches
and ways to protect software programs. This paper provides
a systematic study of maps (SMS) based on our pre-defined
process and the proposed model [18], [19] to highlight
the existing security measures for building secure software.
It is reported that the findings, in our study reported in
this paper, will have an impact on the body of information
by providing a tax on the SSE-related research topic that
may invite researchers to focus on further research in this
field

3) We investigate the outcome of this mapping study to
provide a reference direction for interested and vigilant
researchers to address and explore new research trends and
gaps in the subject domain. The findings of the SMS may
assist the practitioners by providing a deep insight into the
subject domain about security approaches, security limita-
tions, and unresolved specific and general issues.

4) The main purpose of the SMS is to provide formal ways to
integrate the information found in simple basic lessons with
a set of map questions [65]. SMS is a literature study that
focuses on selecting and combining all high-quality research,
related to a specific topic and provides a complete summary
of current texts applicable to specific map queries [66]. Com-
pared to a systematic literature review (SLR), SMS were per-
formed on a wide range of research questions to identify gaps
in a particular research area. It also identifies gaps in existing
subjects and determines trends in future studies [67]–[69].
SMS, therefore, maintains a great imminent value in the field
of software engineering by providing a general view of the
literature in this particular domai

5) Realizou pesquisa de diversas metodologias de segurança com base nos resultados onde encontrou a maior presença de tecnicas de segurança nas fases
de testes e desing the produtos

6) The findings of this research contribute to the SSD context
from various perspectives. Initially, they provide a clearer
understanding of the security practices and methods used
in the SSD environment for the academic community and
explain differences in areas where security approaches are
ineffective or inadequate. This knowledge will open opportu-
nities for SSD researchers to solve problems and design new
security techniques that can minimize the impact of security
risks and threats in the development of secure software. Sec-
ondly, the development of applications participating in highly
distributed projects would provide an overview of current
approaches aimed at promoting their efforts and recognizing
those most likely to meet their needs.
